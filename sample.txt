Interviewer: One clarification, you also come across the HMI/scada assistance.
Interviewee: Yes. We also come across the HMI topic.  The HMI, ofcourse is a very broad concept. It can be applied to many things that I can give you the example of my former company, the company manufacturing 3D printing machines.  We were proposing a new machine to the market and basically one of the strength of this maching was HMI.  Because* we had emphasised the quality of the HMI.  Because we thought it was important to make a breakthrough on the market.  So it ** which receive quite often.  
Interviewer: Okay.  When we go over some of the market trends would you be able to segregate* MESN, HMI scata* because I understand the trends are a little bit different in that space?
Interviewee: I would put the two things at two differents levels.  I think it is not the same level of understanding.  MES is a very broad concept encompassing* several software applications and here the topic is to improve the way the manufacturing resources are managed and to put a layer ** to put an other whole layer* of software and intelligence on several machines or on several industrial equipments or on the whole factory.  You* know that to better manage* and to optimise the manufacturing managnement.  So it is a quite global concept with several way of implementation and it is something which is quite high level for ** atleast* you want* to this* role*.  HMI, on the other hand, is of little global significance since* much more some** which is local.  For example, in a specific rear* of the workshop, you need for, example to handle and to managae a machine.  So true* control to money ** to give orders to get information at the local level.  Specific machine as well as specific process to implement and the reason** ** on this machine, which is basically digital screen with information with data*, which give you feedback in the way the ** is working.  And on the other hand you can also input some ** some controlling* data on the tray* either on the ** or the keyboard. ee* novel to give your orders to the machine.  So that they can achieve high and you can have ** options to make it use oftenly.  The *** for HMI user friendliness so that *** the trend* in* HMI ** which is easy to manage, easy to use, easy to understand without too much training, without big former experience.  It must be easy and straightforward.  So its userfreindliness, which is the key to ** for HMI.  Just* the first indication.
